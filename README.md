#My idea towards this app development #GAWD
We are going to make an app and a website(if possible) which will help not only in both prediction and prevention of natural disasters like earthquake,tsunami,volcano eruption,landslide,hurricanes etc but also in man caused calamities like stampede,riots etc.The basic idea of the app is to take realtime data from various weather monitoring sites and process it using its algorithm and check on the basis of topographical and geographical conditions of an area that wheather its under the danger of some natural calamity or not,it will alert the user and nearby authority with an alarm signal and prevent any further damage from happening.  
This app would even work in disaster management situation,if someone is trapped under certain situation or circumstance in a disaster it will share that person's location with the nearby NDRF or Army officials so that it can further help in the rescue operations.Also generally its seen that disaster affected areas generally suffer from food and water shortage due to their broken contacts with the rest of the world,like recently seen in the kerala floods in India,government felt the shortage of food and water availability since it wass unable to monitor number of people stuck but even in this case, this app can help.
Since it will already contain data of the number of people stuck in predicament it will calculate the optimum amount of food and water required per person and provide the data to the responsible authorities thus providing a major check to the problem.
Also its seen that in case of natural disasters and stampedes generally people suffer from unredeeming of family with further lead to their emotional breakdown in such tense situation.But this idea would help people find their loved ones by searching them in a vast list of the affected people with the app and can connect with them and trace their location and ensure their safety. 
Also it will serve as a basic guide to the peoples stuck in such situations by providing them with certain DOs and DON'Ts which can help them with survivng in such tough situations.
Also as an extra function it will proivde affected citizens with some motivational and inspirational quotes which may help them  with further saving their morals and prevent them from losing hope :-)
